### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Prawin Sankar

I am an Undergrad studemt working currently in multiple domains. 

Robotics, AI, IoT, AR and VR gives me the freedom to be creative and have fun while learning a lot at the same time. I love meeting new people across a diverse range of fields and strongly believe in working coherently as a team to find interdisciplinary and unconventional solutions to problems existing.
